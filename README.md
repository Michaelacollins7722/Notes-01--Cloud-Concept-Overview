1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos:
   - The module covers fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including its history and various service models.
   - It introduces the AWS Management Console and the use of Software Version Control via GitHub.

2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote interesting:
   - Quote 1: "Cloud computing allows businesses to access and use computing resources as needed, rather than investing in and maintaining physical infrastructure."
     - This quote is interesting because it highlights one of the core benefits of cloud computing, which is the flexibility to scale resources on-demand without the burden of managing physical hardware.

   - Quote 2: "In traditional IT, organizations typically have to predict their computing needs and invest in infrastructure upfront, which can be costly and inflexible."
     - This quote underscores the contrast between traditional IT and cloud computing, emphasizing the cost-efficiency and adaptability of cloud-based solutions.

3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section:
   - The readings introduce the concept of cloud computing history, emphasizing its evolution as a cost-effective alternative to traditional IT infrastructure.
   - I learned about the various cloud service models, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
   - The module touches on the significance of the AWS Management Console in managing AWS resources.

4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - I would like to know more about specific use cases for each cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) to understand when to choose one over the other.
   - How does the AWS Management Console work in practical terms? Are there any hands-on exercises or tutorials provided to navigate it effectively?
   - The mention of GitHub as a software version control tool is intriguing. How does it relate to cloud computing, and what role does it play in this context?
